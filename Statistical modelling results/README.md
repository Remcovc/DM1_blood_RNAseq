CBT_effect.xlsx
Results of mixed effect model: gene_expr = CBT(0/1)* + (1|Patient), gene_weights
* 0 indicates before CBT = baseline assessment, 1 indicates after CBT = 10M assessment
CBT_effect is the regression coefficient of the CBT variable, pval its nominal pvalue, FDR its adjusted pvalue

CTG_effect.xlsx
Results of mixed effect model: gene_expr = CBT(0/1) + V2Mode* + (1|Patient), gene_weights
*V2 mode reflects the CTG repeat length at trial start (baseline assessment)
CTG_CBT_** columns reflect the CBT coefficient, nominal pvalue, adjusted pvalue (FDR)
CTG_** columns reflect the CTG coefficient, nominal pvalue, adjusted pvalue (FDR)

Outcome_effects_xlsx
Results of regression models: gene_expr = CBT(0/1) + OutcomeMeasure + (1|Patient), gene weights
* OutcomeMeasure is replaced by one of the clinical outcome measures
OutcomeMeasure_CBT** columns reflect the CBT coefficient, nominal pvalue, adjusted pvalue (FDR) of the associated OutcomeMeasureâ€™s fit
OutcomeMEasure** columns reflect the OutcomeMeasure specific coefficient, nominal pvalue, adjusted pvalue (FDR)

Compound_Response_xlsx
Results of the mixed effect model: gene_expr = CBT(0/1) + CompoundResponse(0/continuous)* + (1|Patient), gene_weights
* CompoundResponse is zero for assessments at baseline, and a continuous score (average delta-response across all outcome measures) at t=10M
Compount_Response_CBT** columns reflect the CBT coefficient, nominal pvalue and adjusted pvalue(FDR)
Compound_Response** columns reflect the CompoundResponse coefficient, nominal pvalue and adjusted pvalue(FDR)

97genes_related_to_CTG_and_improvement
This file was generated by concatenating CTG_effect.xslx and Compound_Response.xlsx (see above) and subsetting the genes with a 
FDR of < 0.05 for both CTG_FDR and Compound_Response_FDR
