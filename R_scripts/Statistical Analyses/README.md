Mixed_model_gene_expression.R contains count normalization and fitting of mixed effect models to with CBT-effect, 
CTG-counts, Outcome Measures and Compound Response scores to gene expression.

Residual_fit_analysis.R Script used to study the impact of the correlation between CTG-repeat and Compound Response estimates
on figure 5

GSEA_gprofiler.R Gene set enrichment analysis for the different identified gene sets in the ReCognitION RNA-seq analyses:
CBT-associated, CTG-associated, Clinical Response associated, Overlap_97_associated

Gene_CR_prediction.R Script to study the predictive value of baseline gene expression values for therapy response (based on the Compound Response variable)

Gene_phenptype_cor.R Script to study the pearson correlation of the 97 candidate biomarkers with therapry response (based on delta-DM1-Activ-c and Compound Response variable)
